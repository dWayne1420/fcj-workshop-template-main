## Access the application and test the API using Postman

After the deployment succeeds, Elastic Beanstalk provides a URL in the format:

```bash
http://<environment-id>.<region>.elasticbeanstalk.com
```

![Example](images/2-Proposal/domain.jpg)

Use this URL to send requests from Postman to the Spring Boot API.

Example:

```bash
GET http://<env>.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/hello
```

If the API responds with the expected data, the deployment is considered successful.
