## Enabling Digital Transformation to Advance Healthcare  
**By: Michael Leonard**

Healthcare organizations (HCOs) are navigating mounting challenges and emerging opportunities that are reshaping the industry. From the 2024 cyberattack on Change Healthcare to widespread provider–payer disruptions affecting patient access, the pressure to transform is stronger than ever.

Emerging technologies—especially **generative AI (GenAI)** and **cloud computing**—offer new ways to revolutionize patient care while improving operational efficiency and strengthening security frameworks.

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and third-party solutions available through **AWS Marketplace** equip HCOs with modern tools to:

- Enhance data security  
- Accelerate AI adoption  
- Streamline clinical and administrative workflows  
- Improve patient outcomes  

I recently moderated a panel discussion titled *“Enabling Digital Transformation to Advance Healthcare,”* where leaders explored how organizations can navigate uncertainty while embracing new technologies. The conversation incorporated insights from Forrester’s latest survey of **441 U.S. healthcare organizations**, examining cloud infrastructure strategies, GenAI adoption, security, and compliance.

Our panel included:

- **Shannon Germain Farraher**, Senior Analyst, Forrester  
- **Demetri Giannikopoulos**, Director of Transformation, Aidoc  
- **Dr. Dan Rafter**, SVP Partnerships and Product Strategy, Flywheel  
- **Wilson To**, VP Strategy, Philips  

This post highlights the key insights shared during our discussion.

## 🔍 Key Findings from the Forrester Research

Forrester’s study identified four critical focus areas driving digital transformation initiatives across healthcare organizations.

### **1. Security takes center stage**
- **92%** of respondents ranked improving enterprise security and reducing risk as their **top priority**.  
- According to the FBI, healthcare was the **most targeted industry in 2023**.

> “For hackers, it's low-hanging fruit—there are so many unprotected points of entry.” — *Farraher*

---

### **2. Data and analytics power AI initiatives**
A robust data foundation is essential for successful AI.

- **44%** cited security concerns as their top infrastructure challenge.  
- Poor data hygiene limits the value of GenAI.

> “If you don’t have a strong data foundation, any fancy GenAI sitting on top won’t help.”

---

### **3. Workforce experience drives investment decisions**
- **90%** of organizations plan to increase tech infrastructure spending by at least **10%** this year.  
- **83%** expect revenue improvements.  
- **79%** anticipate improved workforce engagement and experience.

---

### **4. GenAI adoption is rapidly maturing**
- 20% of organizations are already at the **enterprise or scaling** stage.  
- This number is expected to reach **90% within three years**.

Key use cases include:

- Workflow optimization (56%)  
- Data integration and analytics  
- Personalized care treatment pathways

##  Converging Forces Accelerating Healthcare Transformation

Unlike previous healthcare innovation cycles, several forces are converging to accelerate change today:

###  **Evolving regulations (FHIR, interoperability)**  
Recent policy updates increasingly reference the need for interoperable healthcare data.

###  **A culture of rapid innovation post-pandemic**  
The pandemic proved that healthcare can innovate quickly under pressure.

###  **Organic demand for GenAI integration**  
GenAI has become mainstream.

> “People use generative AI every day—it has become part of their workflow.” — *Farraher*

This trend contrasts sharply with previous technologies like EHR systems that required extensive training.

##  Strategic Approaches to AI Deployment

Healthcare organizations are taking a balanced, pragmatic approach to GenAI:

- **Automation** to reduce administrative burden  
- **Augmentation** to enhance clinical capabilities  
- **Rapid insight generation** to support care delivery  

> “There are so many moments that can be saved—customers want to see how we can deploy technology on behalf of their clinicians.”

Successful deployment requires:

- Clear initial use cases  
- Learning from industry peers  
- Comprehensive workflows  
- Strong change management alongside technology adoption  

> “Start with the right use cases. Learn from others. Develop a full end-to-end process.” — *Giannikopoulos*

---

##  Overcoming Data and Infrastructure Barriers

### **Data standardization is the biggest obstacle**
Organizations spend up to **85% of their time** locating, de-identifying, and preparing data before analysis.

> “It’s a fully manual process without the right tools.” — *Dr. Rafter*

### **Shift from departmental tools to enterprise platforms**
- Breaking down data silos  
- Improving interoperability  
- Enabling precision medicine (genomics + imaging + EHR)

---

### **Cloud infrastructure is no longer optional**
> “It’s no longer a question of whether we should centralize data beyond hospital walls—it must happen.” — *Dr. Rafter*

---

##  Security and Compliance Strategies

Healthcare organizations leverage the **shared responsibility model**, dividing security obligations across:

- Internal teams  
- Cloud service providers  
- Solution vendors  

Core principles include:

- **Security by design**  
- Alignment with **ISO**, **SOC 2 Type II**, HIPAA  
- Clear documentation & transparent accountability  

> “Security is priority zero. Patient safety is at the center of everything.”

##  Four Strategic Recommendations for Navigating Digital Transformation

Forrester identified four key recommendations for HCOs:

### **1. Advocate for unified AI governance frameworks**
Leverage organizations like **CHAI (Coalition for Health AI)**.

### **2. Harness the momentum of Bring-Your-Own-AI (BYOAI)**
Over 20% of clinicians already use AI tools in their workflows.

Guide staff toward **approved, secure** tools rather than punitive measures.

---

### **3. Ground decisions in core organizational values**
Continue investments in:

- Workforce recognition  
- Mission alignment  
- Employee autonomy  

> “Recognition shouldn’t be the first thing cut—rather, the last.”

---

### **4. Choose partners that align with your values**
Partners should provide:

- Flexibility  
- Cost efficiency  
- Minimal disruption  
- Long-term support  

> “Challenge your partners—ensure they meet your needs today and tomorrow.”

---

##  Conclusion

Healthcare is at a pivotal transformational moment. The question is no longer **whether** to adopt AI and cloud, but **how to implement them safely and at scale**.

Organizations that thrive will:

- Prioritize security  
- Elevate workforce experience  
- Build strong strategic partnerships  
- Stay true to patient-centered missions  

> “Behind every pixel, behind every bit and byte, is a patient.” — *Wilson To*

The next few years will distinguish organizations that **lead** from those that merely **survive**.
