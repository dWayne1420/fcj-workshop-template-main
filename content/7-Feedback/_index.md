# Sharing & Feedback
## 1. Overall Evaluation
### **1.1. Working Environment**
The working environment at AWS is very professional, friendly, and open. Everyone is always ready to support me when I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is modern, with clear processes that make it easy to focus and integrate.  
However, I think AWS could organize more internal activities or team bonding events to increase connection between interns and full-time staff.

### **1.2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**
The mentor guides in detail, explains clearly, and always encourages me to research myself rather than providing direct answers.  
The team admin fully supports documents, training accounts, schedules, and related procedures, allowing me to focus on learning and practicing.

### **1.3. Job Alignment with Major**
The tasks are directly related to cloud computing, security, networking, and DevOps — all align with my major.  
Interning at AWS helps me apply the knowledge learned at school to a real environment, especially when doing labs on system architecture and security.

### **1.4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**
During the internship, I gained many valuable skills such as:
- Using AWS services (EC2, S3, CloudFront, IAM, WAF, Shield, Lambda…)
- Thinking in building sustainable architecture & cost optimization
- Teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills
- Report writing, information synthesis, and professional presentation skills
- Security, DevOps, and automation mindset

The mentor shared a lot of practical experience, giving me a clearer career direction.

### **1.5. Culture & Team Spirit**
AWS has a very positive work culture: respectful, transparent, proactive, continuously learning.  
When tasks are urgent, everyone supports each other wholeheartedly, regardless of role or seniority. This makes me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

### **1.6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**
AWS provides learning accounts, training materials, flexible schedules, and many internal workshops.  
These are practical benefits that help interns learn quickly, grasp knowledge thoroughly, and have opportunities to develop themselves.
